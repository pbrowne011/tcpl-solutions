Solutions to Kernighan & Ritchie's book, "The C Programming Language", 2nd
edition. All solutions were compiled using gcc 11.4.0.

Exercises do not have a standardized format (yet). They contain as many test
cases as I decided to test for a particular problem. The better-formatted ones
have the implemented functions in separate source files. To compile, run
commands similar to this one (for exercise 2-5):

    $ gcc strpbrk.c test.c -o test

    $ ./test < test.in
